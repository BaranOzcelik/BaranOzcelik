### Hi there 👋,

I've been a software developer since 2016, with a passion for coding that has become an integral part of my life. While my journey began with web development, I am now fully immersed in the world of game development, a field that has always been my true passion.

Currently, I am actively developing games using Unity, constantly honing my skills and exploring new techniques. My background in UI/UX design complements my game development work, allowing me to create not only functional but also visually engaging and user-friendly experiences.

As I continue to grow and evolve as a developer, I am committed to pushing the boundaries of my creativity and technical expertise. My dedication to learning and improving ensures that each project I undertake is better than the last, and I believe that there is always more to discover and achieve.
